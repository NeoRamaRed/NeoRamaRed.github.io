			<h3>A Summary</h3>
			<p>Linux is a family of Unix based operating systems based on the Monolithic Linux Kernel developed initially released in 1991 by Linus Torvalds</p>
			<p> Linus initially began working on his kernel as a response to the lack of a widely adopted free operating kernel. At the time most operating systems were proprietary and expensive leading to a demand for an open source system. Originally intended for his own personal use Torvalds released the operating system under the GNU license allowing anyone to modify or redistribute the code.</p>
			<p>Despite the earlier attempt of the GNU project failing to finish work on a free unix based operating system based on the GNU Hurd kernel. The availability of the project's toolings and libraries allowed multiple Linux based operating systems to be created from the non proprietary code.</p>

			<h3>History and Creation</h3>
			<p>Linus Torvalds was a Finnish computer science student studying at the university of Helsinki when he began the project. He created the program to work specifically with his personal hardware (i386 based personal computer) and initially started the project as a personal project.</p>
			<p>Development was done on MINIX (a UNIX based system) and the GNU C compiler. He worked to implement UNIX based system calls into his system and learned through his university courses and datamining the SunOS system at his university.</p>
			<p>He released the initial version of the Linux kernel in September 1991, the initial version  contained 10,239 lines of code. By December of 91, he released version 0.11 which was the first version that could be compiled on a computer operating on the same kernel version. By 1992 the project adopted the GNU license to further differentiate itself from MINIX and to solidify itself as free software. In the same year the x Window System was ported to Linux allowing Linux to support GUI. By 1999 the kernel saw such improvement it was compatible with Enterprise level machines, specifically IBM mainframe patches. </p>

			<h3>Distribution and Use</h3>
			<p>Multiple different distributions of Linux exist and have been created due to the open source nature of the kernel. Mint, Ubuntu, Red Hat, and Arch are only a few examples.</p>
			<p>Around 70 percent of mobile devices run on Linux based systems, close to 3 percent of desktop computers run Linux, and nearly 90 percent of supercomputers run Linux. The Open source nature of the kernel combined with the security and customization has led to a widespread adoption of its use.
